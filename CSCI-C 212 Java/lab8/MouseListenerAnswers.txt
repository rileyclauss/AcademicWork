What is the difference between pressing and clicking a mouse in Java?

Pressing a mouse is pushing down the button/lever to register contact within the mouse.
It is possible to press a mouse, hold it, drag it around, and then release it. However,
clicking is the act of pressing in and releasing the mouse as near simultaneously as 
possible.

How does the use of interfaces help with interchangeability of classes? For
example, what if we wanted to have a different implementation of MouseListener
in the future?

Implementations help create modular objects, so that the same behavior can
produce different results, I could replace MyMouseListener with YourMouseListener,
and since they both implement the same MouseListener, they are interchangeable.
