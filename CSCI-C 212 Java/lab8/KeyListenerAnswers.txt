What is the difference between pressing and clicking a key in Java?

    Pressing a key is the input of a button on the keyboard, but typing is 
    the input of a specific character on the keyboard. If I want to do something
    when any key is pressed, I can use keyPressed or keyReleased, but if I want to
    do something specific for that letter, I need to use keyTyped.

How could an implementation of the KeyListener interface be used to handle
multiple characters entered in a row rather than just one character at a time?

    keyTyped could add to a string until a delimiter is entered, like a 
    comma or semicolon.
